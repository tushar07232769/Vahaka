# VAHAKA - Electric Scooter Simulator for Automotive Cybersecurity Practice

## 🚦 About VAHAKA

The name **VAHAKA** (वाहक) is derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit manuscripts, where it means **"carrier" or "vehicle"**. The term symbolizes a medium of movement—perfectly aligning with our mission to offer a dynamic and educational platform for exploring mobility-related cybersecurity threats and defenses.

VAHAKA is designed to replicate the key electronic and communication features of modern electric scooters. It provides a realistic and extensible environment for simulating various attack scenarios.
